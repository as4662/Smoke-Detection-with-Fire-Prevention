# Smoke-Detection-with-Fire-Prevention
Home fire detection is a matter of great concern, and thus many efforts are devoted in
most developed countries to the design of automatic detection systems. A fire
prevention system should reliably and in a timely way notify building occupants about the
presence of fire indicators, such as smoke or high temperatures. A fire detector is usually
implemented as a smoke sensor due to its early fire detection capability, fast response
time, and relatively low cost. Other options for fire detection are based on gas sensors or
temperature sensors fire detectors that use a single sensor, generally a smoke sensor,
and present high false-siren rates due to temperature changes.



===>Components needed


Step 1)Create a House
Step 2)Place the smoke detector in the house
Step 3)Place the fire prevention tools
	-->fire sprinkler
	-->Open window and door
	-->Play Siren

Step 4) Place home Gateway
Step 5) Place the smart device for access the data
Step 6) Connect/configure all component with home gateway
	-->Take a switch to connect 
	-->Connect switch with home gateway
	-->Configure each component with home gateway
	-->Rename them (I done already)

Step 7) Check them all are connected(Access from smart device)
	-->Username=admin password = admin
	-->All sensor are connected 

Step 8) Write condition for automation of fire prevention
	-->When any smoke detector sense the smoke then
		-->on Siren
		-->on sprinkler
		-->Open windows
		-->Open doors

	-->When all smoke detector no smoke
		-->off siren
		-->off sprinkler

Step 9) Let check our system working completely or not
	-->Let me generate some smoke using car (alt+click)
		-->it will open all window ,doors
		-->start sprinkler
		-->start siren
		=====ALL start completely===
	--> After stop the smoke it will off
		-->sprinklers 
		-->siren
